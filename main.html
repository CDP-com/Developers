    <strong>One Solution to Solve Your Technology Problems</strong>
	
	<p>SnapBack is a growing collection of Apps designed to solve your technology problems quickly, easily and safely. Our Development Community is actively creating solutions available for you today and in the future. This app installs the development environment so you can develop SnapBack Apps.</p>
			
	<strong>Development Environment Key Features</strong>
		<ul>
		   <li>The environment has the same folder structure and common files as production.</li>
		   <li>The environment provides common files and functions for the developers to use.</li>
		   <li>The developer can put the environment on their windows machine.</li>
		   <li>The developer can work on new or existing apps</li>
		   <li>The environment provides app templates so the developer does not need to create the User Interface</li>
		   <li>The developer can create his own private apps</li>
		</ul>

	<strong>Why you need the Development Environment</strong><Br>
	   <ul>
		  <li>The Easiest way to Create or Modify SnapBack Apps.</li>
		  <li>Provides an environment that emulates production for testing</li>
	   </ul>
	
	<p>
        <form>
            Install Path: <input id="pn" type="text" size="60" maxlength="80" value="c:\users\public" >
        </form>
    </p>
    
	<div id="cdpbutton1">
        <p><button package="devinstaller" id="runApp" onclick="runInstall()">Install<br> Development<br> Environment</span></button></p>

    </div>
       
	<strong>Modify a Copy of the HelloWorld App</strong>
	
	<p>Make sure the Install Path above is the one you want to use.</p>

	<p>The Modify button below will:
		<ul>
            <li>Copy the Hello World App into a new folder named MyFirstApp</li>
			<li>Open an Explorer Window to your new App folder</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>Next you can edit the displaymessage.js file, changing the message to be displayed.<br>Save the files changes.<br>Then Run main.hta file from the Explorer Window.</p>

	<p class="developers-message">[To the Developer - Use this section to detail any associated costs with your app.]</p>
	
	<p><strong>No Cost to You.</strong></p>
	
	<p>All SnapBack Apps are free for both business and personal use, provided that the SnapBack Platform is "hand installed", by a user and not "mass installed".    However, for some apps they may be working with or modify another application, such as Microsoft Word, which is obviously not free.  Sometimes we might independently offer that application to you with a link to a separate page.  If and when we offer you the software, we warrant that to our best ability, we've fully disclosed which products in that category are best, the least cost prices with links, along with any dissenting opinions from contributors like you. </p>
	
	<p>For all our users, contributors, attributable sources, and other companies, we've prepared an easy to understand page that explains all our <a id="policiesterms" href="#" >Policies, Complete Terms, and Conditions of our SnapBack Apps, Platform, website, and our SnapBack Apps Factory</a> where they are produced.  Together, this page, the FAQ, and the discussions of users, contributors, and CDP should convince you that this project is worthy of your full support.</p>
	
	<strong>How We Make Our Money...</strong>
  
</div><!--End Tab2-->
      				
<div id="tab3">
			
	<p>The Developers environment is installed on your system under the "Users/Public" folder. It shares a folder structure with the production environment which allows you to modify existing apps in your development area.</p>
    
	<strong>The File / Folder Structure</strong>
		<p>...</p>
			
    <strong>System Impacts</strong></br>
	<ul>
		<li>Tested on XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. Please let us know if you find any issues.</li>
		<li>Currently, less than 2MB drive space required.  This will grow as we add functionality to our library, more sample apps and templates, and tools to make development and testing easier.</li>

	<h3>Tell others:</h3>
	<p>Show how a SnapBack App is a solution to an asked question on sites like SuperUser.com.  Many sites offer written solutions that advise, if you hand-type or apply the fix.  Often, the solutions published vary in quality, method, have no error handling, and require more context and understanding than most users have. By simply referring them to that specific App's page, users on that site can simply choose to and safely apply that fix with a single click, (or first install SnapBack).  Read "best practices" and "example answers" to a posted problem, using links to a specific SnapBack App page.</p>

	<p><strong>The SnapBack Apps Factory is a platform where</strong> regular users interact with, or become App contributors and developers themselves.  Most technology products initially frustrates users unnecessarily.  If new versions were produced daily, users and developers were constantly communicating, products would quickly evolve to work perfectly.  SnapBack Apps' mission is to modify how any existing hardware and software interacts with ordinary users.   Our Factory connects users, contributors and developers in near real time to create or improve SnapBack Apps.  Changes that are apparently required are quickly communicated, applied and deployed to all users within hours.  Eventually, all changes that any user would ever want, are created and deployed.  The SnapBack Apps Factory platform is where contributors and users of all kinds communicate, design, and ultimately work together to accomplish this mission.</p>
